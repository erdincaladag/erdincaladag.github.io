      <b>Abstract</b>
    </summary>
<p>The demand for pharmacological products is increasing day by day with the remaining importance given to the treatment of diseases and human health. These pharmaceuticals and their metabolites, which are released into the environment with the domestic, hospital, and pharmaceutical industry wastewater, pose a serious threat to the aquatic ecosystem and public health.<sup>1</sup> Even if high-efficiency wastewater treatment is accomplished with conventional wastewater treatment technologies, the total removal of organic micropollutants cannot be achieved.<sup>2</sup> Microalgae are known to have an important role in the removal of pharmaceutical compounds from wastewater.<sup>3</sup> <br>In this study, the removal of paracetamol and diclofenac pharmaceuticals under photoautotrophic conditions using <i>Scenedesmus sp.</i> was investigated. The microalgae strain was illuminated for 12 hours per day with a light intensity of 100 µmol-photon/m<sup>2</sup>·s at 25 ± 1 °C. At the end of the 8-day experiment period, 69% and 91% removal efficiencies were obtained for paracetamol and diclofenac, respectively. These results show that <i>Scenedesmus sp.</i> is a suitable microalgae species for bioremediation of wastewater containing paracetamol and diclofenac.</p>

      <b>Abstract</b>
    </summary>
<p>Large amounts of wastewater containing heavy metals are produced by anthropogenic activities. The discharge of toxic metal-rich wastewater into the receiving environment without treatment poses a serious threat to living organisms in the ecosystem and public health. Nowadays, many advanced treatment methods are applied for the treatment of this type of wastewater. Microalgae are biomaterials with sustainable potential in the removal of toxic and harmful substances in wastewater. In addition to biodegradation and bioaccumulation processes, significant heavy metals are removed from wastewater by biosorption by microalgae. The functional groups that bind metal ions in the cell wall of microalgae make them important biosorbents in heavy metal biosorption. Heavy metals are removed from wastewater by microalgae through active and passive biosorption. The active biosorption process that occurs in living cells is more sensitive to medium conditions than passive biosorption, takes place more slowly, and has lower metal uptake. Biosorption efficiency is affected by many conditions such as microalgae strain and biosorbent amount, wastewater type, heavy metal ions and concentration, contact time, mixing, pH, and temperature of the solution. Despite its high heavy metal sorption capacity, microalgal biosorption has difficulties such as free suspension of microalgae, small particle size, low chemical resistance, low mechanical strength, and separation from treated wastewater. In future studies, overcoming these difficulties can realize a cost-effective and sustainable microalgal biosorption process.</p>

      <b>Abstract</b>
    </summary>
<p>A wide variety of dyestuffs are used in industries such as textiles, cosmetics, paper, leather, pharmaceuticals and food. The presence of these colored and synthetic wastes in the aquatic environment, even in very small quantities, adversely affects the aquatic ecosystem and causes toxic effects. Discharge of dyestuffs without removing them from wastewater reduces the amount of dissolved oxygen in the receiving environment and contributes to the high chemical oxidation demand. It is also a serious threat to public health: overexposure to the dye causes skin irritation, respiratory problems and increases the risk of cancer. Therefore, effective treatment of dye-containing wastewater is of great importance in order to ensure safe discharge. <br>In this study, the adsorption of crystal violet cationic dye, which is widely used in many industries, from aqueous solutions onto montmorillonite, a natural clay, was investigated. The experiments were carried out at an initial dye concentration of 100 mg/L, an adsorbent dosage of 0.1 g/100 mL, a pH of 6.2 (natural) and a shaking speed of 100 rpm for 60 minutes. In batch adsorption studies at 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 °C, removal efficiencies of 84.07%, 84.88%, 85.90%, 86.57% and 87.06% were obtained, respectively. It was found that the experimental data fit the pseudo-second-order reaction kinetics (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99). The activation energy was found to be 12.12 kJ/mol. The relatively low activation energy indicates that physical adsorption has occurred. The thermodynamic parameters ΔH° and ΔS° were calculated as 9.52 kJ/mol and -237.02 J/mol K, respectively. A positive ΔH° value indicates that the adsorption reaction is endothermic. Negative activation entropy reveals a lower tendency towards randomness at the solid/solution interface. ΔG° increases from 79.00 kJ/mol to 88.48 kJ/mol depending on the temperature. The findings show that the adsorption of montmorillonite and crystal violet is favorable with the increase in temperature.</p>

      <b>Abstract</b>
    </summary>
<p>Particulate matter that enters with the bloodstream through respiration and can reach deep into the lung tissue; It is among the important atmospheric pollutants in terms of public health. High particulate matter pollution is responsible for at least 4.1 million deaths worldwide each year. Also in Turkey, it is associated with premature birth, cardiovascular diseases and many respiratory diseases. The province of Iğdır, chosen as the study area, is home to the most polluted city center in our country. In this study, monthly, annual averages and trends of PM<sub>10</sub> concentration measured in the city center of Iğdır between the years 2008-2021 were examined. The highest average PM<sub>10</sub> amount was measured in January (222.30 µg/m<sup>3</sup>), December (222.30 µg/m<sup>3</sup>), November and February (183.52 µg/m<sup>3</sup>), respectively. In addition, measurements were made above the annual guide value (15 µg/m<sup>3</sup>) recommended by WHO (World Health Organization) and the limit value (40 µg/m<sup>3</sup>) determined by the Air Quality Assessment and Management Regulation (HKDYY) in all years. In order to determine the trends, two different trend analysis methods, namely Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope tests, were applied. According to the results, no decrease was detected in the amount of particulate matter on a monthly and annual basis. Despite that; respectively, in October (4.16 µg/m<sup>3</sup>·year), September (2.67 µg/m<sup>3</sup>·year), June (2.28 µg/m<sup>3</sup>·year) and May (1.41 µg/m<sup>3</sup>·year) significant increasing trends were determined. The findings reveal that the air pollution measures in the city center of Iğdır are insufficient. It is recommended that more effective measures be taken by legislators and local governments so that more people are not adversely affected by environmental problems that may be caused by particulate matter pollution in the future.</p>
