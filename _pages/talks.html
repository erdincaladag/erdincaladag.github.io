      <b>Abstract</b>
    </summary>
<p>The demand for pharmacological products is increasing day by day with the remaining importance given to the treatment of diseases and human health. These pharmaceuticals and their metabolites, which are released into the environment with the domestic, hospital, and pharmaceutical industry wastewater, pose a serious threat to the aquatic ecosystem and public health.<sup>1</sup> Even if high-efficiency wastewater treatment is accomplished with conventional wastewater treatment technologies, the total removal of organic micropollutants cannot be achieved.<sup>2</sup> Microalgae are known to have an important role in the removal of pharmaceutical compounds from wastewater.<sup>3</sup> <br>In this study, the removal of paracetamol and diclofenac pharmaceuticals under photoautotrophic conditions using <i>Scenedesmus sp.</i> was investigated. The microalgae strain was illuminated for 12 hours per day with a light intensity of 100 µmol-photon/m<sup>2</sup>·s at 25 ± 1 °C. At the end of the 8-day experiment period, 69% and 91% removal efficiencies were obtained for paracetamol and diclofenac, respectively. These results show that <i>Scenedesmus sp.</i> is a suitable microalgae species for bioremediation of wastewater containing paracetamol and diclofenac.</p>

      <b>Abstract</b>
    </summary>
<p>Large amounts of wastewater containing heavy metals are produced by anthropogenic activities. The discharge of toxic metal-rich wastewater into the receiving environment without treatment poses a serious threat to living organisms in the ecosystem and public health. Nowadays, many advanced treatment methods are applied for the treatment of this type of wastewater. Microalgae are biomaterials with sustainable potential in the removal of toxic and harmful substances in wastewater. In addition to biodegradation and bioaccumulation processes, significant heavy metals are removed from wastewater by biosorption by microalgae. The functional groups that bind metal ions in the cell wall of microalgae make them important biosorbents in heavy metal biosorption. Heavy metals are removed from wastewater by microalgae through active and passive biosorption. The active biosorption process that occurs in living cells is more sensitive to medium conditions than passive biosorption, takes place more slowly, and has lower metal uptake. Biosorption efficiency is affected by many conditions such as microalgae strain and biosorbent amount, wastewater type, heavy metal ions and concentration, contact time, mixing, pH, and temperature of the solution. Despite its high heavy metal sorption capacity, microalgal biosorption has difficulties such as free suspension of microalgae, small particle size, low chemical resistance, low mechanical strength, and separation from treated wastewater. In future studies, overcoming these difficulties can realize a cost-effective and sustainable microalgal biosorption process.</p>
