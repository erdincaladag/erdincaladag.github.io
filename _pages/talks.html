      <b>Abstract</b>
    </summary>
<p>The demand for pharmacological products is increasing day by day with the remaining importance given to the treatment of diseases and human health. These pharmaceuticals and their metabolites, which are released into the environment with the domestic, hospital, and pharmaceutical industry wastewater, pose a serious threat to the aquatic ecosystem and public health.<sup>1</sup> Even if high-efficiency wastewater treatment is accomplished with conventional wastewater treatment technologies, the total removal of organic micropollutants cannot be achieved.<sup>2</sup> Microalgae are known to have an important role in the removal of pharmaceutical compounds from wastewater.<sup>3</sup> <br>In this study, the removal of paracetamol and diclofenac pharmaceuticals under photoautotrophic conditions using <i>Scenedesmus sp.</i> was investigated. The microalgae strain was illuminated for 12 hours per day with a light intensity of 100 µmol-photon/m<sup>2</sup>·s at 25 ± 1 °C. At the end of the 8-day experiment period, 69% and 91% removal efficiencies were obtained for paracetamol and diclofenac, respectively. These results show that <i>Scenedesmus sp.</i> is a suitable microalgae species for bioremediation of wastewater containing paracetamol and diclofenac.</p>
