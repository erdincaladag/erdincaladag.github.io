      <b>Abstract</b>
    </summary>
<p>The demand for pharmacological products is increasing day by day with the remaining importance given to the treatment of diseases and human health. These pharmaceuticals and their metabolites, which are released into the environment with the domestic, hospital, and pharmaceutical industry wastewater, pose a serious threat to the aquatic ecosystem and public health.<sup>1</sup> Even if high-efficiency wastewater treatment is accomplished with conventional wastewater treatment technologies, the total removal of organic micropollutants cannot be achieved.<sup>2</sup> Microalgae are known to have an important role in the removal of pharmaceutical compounds from wastewater.<sup>3</sup> <br>In this study, the removal of paracetamol and diclofenac pharmaceuticals under photoautotrophic conditions using <i>Scenedesmus sp.</i> was investigated. The microalgae strain was illuminated for 12 hours per day with a light intensity of 100 µmol-photon/m<sup>2</sup>·s at 25 ± 1 °C. At the end of the 8-day experiment period, 69% and 91% removal efficiencies were obtained for paracetamol and diclofenac, respectively. These results show that <i>Scenedesmus sp.</i> is a suitable microalgae species for bioremediation of wastewater containing paracetamol and diclofenac.</p>

      <b>Abstract</b>
    </summary>
<p>Large amounts of wastewater containing heavy metals are produced by anthropogenic activities. The discharge of toxic metal-rich wastewater into the receiving environment without treatment poses a serious threat to living organisms in the ecosystem and public health. Nowadays, many advanced treatment methods are applied for the treatment of this type of wastewater. Microalgae are biomaterials with sustainable potential in the removal of toxic and harmful substances in wastewater. In addition to biodegradation and bioaccumulation processes, significant heavy metals are removed from wastewater by biosorption by microalgae. The functional groups that bind metal ions in the cell wall of microalgae make them important biosorbents in heavy metal biosorption. Heavy metals are removed from wastewater by microalgae through active and passive biosorption. The active biosorption process that occurs in living cells is more sensitive to medium conditions than passive biosorption, takes place more slowly, and has lower metal uptake. Biosorption efficiency is affected by many conditions such as microalgae strain and biosorbent amount, wastewater type, heavy metal ions and concentration, contact time, mixing, pH, and temperature of the solution. Despite its high heavy metal sorption capacity, microalgal biosorption has difficulties such as free suspension of microalgae, small particle size, low chemical resistance, low mechanical strength, and separation from treated wastewater. In future studies, overcoming these difficulties can realize a cost-effective and sustainable microalgal biosorption process.</p>

      <b>Abstract</b>
    </summary>
<p>A wide variety of dyestuffs are used in industries such as textiles, cosmetics, paper, leather, pharmaceuticals and food. The presence of these colored and synthetic wastes in the aquatic environment, even in very small quantities, adversely affects the aquatic ecosystem and causes toxic effects. Discharge of dyestuffs without removing them from wastewater reduces the amount of dissolved oxygen in the receiving environment and contributes to the high chemical oxidation demand. It is also a serious threat to public health: overexposure to the dye causes skin irritation, respiratory problems and increases the risk of cancer. Therefore, effective treatment of dye-containing wastewater is of great importance in order to ensure safe discharge. <br>In this study, the adsorption of crystal violet cationic dye, which is widely used in many industries, from aqueous solutions onto montmorillonite, a natural clay, was investigated. The experiments were carried out at an initial dye concentration of 100 mg/L, an adsorbent dosage of 0.1 g/100 mL, a pH of 6.2 (natural) and a shaking speed of 100 rpm for 60 minutes. In batch adsorption studies at 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 °C, removal efficiencies of 84.07%, 84.88%, 85.90%, 86.57% and 87.06% were obtained, respectively. It was found that the experimental data fit the pseudo-second-order reaction kinetics (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99). The activation energy was found to be 12.12 kJ/mol. The relatively low activation energy indicates that physical adsorption has occurred. The thermodynamic parameters ΔH° and ΔS° were calculated as 9.52 kJ/mol and -237.02 J/mol K, respectively. A positive ΔH° value indicates that the adsorption reaction is endothermic. Negative activation entropy reveals a lower tendency towards randomness at the solid/solution interface. ΔG° increases from 79.00 kJ/mol to 88.48 kJ/mol depending on the temperature. The findings show that the adsorption of montmorillonite and crystal violet is favorable with the increase in temperature.</p>

      <b>Abstract</b>
    </summary>
<p>Particulate matter that enters with the bloodstream through respiration and can reach deep into the lung tissue; It is among the important atmospheric pollutants in terms of public health. High particulate matter pollution is responsible for at least 4.1 million deaths worldwide each year. Also in Turkey, it is associated with premature birth, cardiovascular diseases and many respiratory diseases. The province of Iğdır, chosen as the study area, is home to the most polluted city center in our country. In this study, monthly, annual averages and trends of PM<sub>10</sub> concentration measured in the city center of Iğdır between the years 2008-2021 were examined. The highest average PM<sub>10</sub> amount was measured in January (222.30 µg/m<sup>3</sup>), December (222.30 µg/m<sup>3</sup>), November and February (183.52 µg/m<sup>3</sup>), respectively. In addition, measurements were made above the annual guide value (15 µg/m<sup>3</sup>) recommended by WHO (World Health Organization) and the limit value (40 µg/m<sup>3</sup>) determined by the Air Quality Assessment and Management Regulation (HKDYY) in all years. In order to determine the trends, two different trend analysis methods, namely Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope tests, were applied. According to the results, no decrease was detected in the amount of particulate matter on a monthly and annual basis. Despite that; respectively, in October (4.16 µg/m<sup>3</sup>·year), September (2.67 µg/m<sup>3</sup>·year), June (2.28 µg/m<sup>3</sup>·year) and May (1.41 µg/m<sup>3</sup>·year) significant increasing trends were determined. The findings reveal that the air pollution measures in the city center of Iğdır are insufficient. It is recommended that more effective measures be taken by legislators and local governments so that more people are not adversely affected by environmental problems that may be caused by particulate matter pollution in the future.</p>

      <b>Abstract</b>
    </summary>
<p>Industrial wastewaters have a very complex characterization. Depending on the type of industry and the product produced, many special pollutants emerge. Dyes are widely used in many industries such as paint, paper, textile, food, leather and cosmetics, producing colored products. Most of the colorants in the contents of colored wastewater, do not undergo biodegradation in receiving environments. Therefore, even very small concentrations of dyestuffs disrupt the natural structure of the receiving media. Adsorption is one of the most suitable methods for the removal of cationic dyes. In equilibrium studies in which the removal of Auramine-O as a cationic dye onto bottom sludge obtaıned from the Damar Waste Dam, was investigated, the results were applied to the Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin Radushchevich isotherms. According to the results, 0.9981 correlation coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>) showed that adsorption was best matched to Langmuir isotherm. The E value calculated from Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm equation is calculated as 0.13 kJ/mol. According to this information, the mechanism of adsorption can be physical. It can also be said that the bottom sludge is suitable and usable for the removal of cationic dyes from the textile industry wastewater. In addition, the fact that the bottom sludge is a waste adsorbent, is suitable for the use of waste back to the final removal of the waste from the dam, and does not require expenditure in the economic sense indicates the importance of this adsorbent. We believe that this study will shed light on many future researches.</p>

      <b>Abstract</b>
    </summary>
<p><sup>238</sup>U is the most common isotope of uranium found in nature, with a relative abundance of 99%. Generally, the highest potential radiation-related health risk for uranium mining or processing facility workers is lung cancer associated with inhaling uranium decay products. One of the most suitable methods for the removal of <sup>238</sup>U is adsorption. So it is important in adsorption procedure to use low-cost and highly efficient adsorbents. While in a laboratory-scale study a small amount of adsorbent material is used, on industrial scale it will use tons of adsorbent. For this reason, adsorbent must be abundant in nature and cost efficient. Diatomite is a naturally occurring, soft, siliceous sedimentary rock that is easily crumbled into a fine white to off-white powder. With this research the adsorption of <sup>238</sup>U ions on Diatomite collected from the deposits located at the Kahramankazan in Ankara in Turkey was investigated in continuous coloumn system. Column’s height is 40 mm and radius is 25 mm. Feeding solution flow rate was selected as 25 mL/min. Under optimum operational conditions maximum adsorption yield was observed as 94%. The results suggest that Diatomite can be used as efficient and cost effective adsorbent for <sup>238</sup>U removal.</p>

    </summary>
<p>Due to mining activities and increasing energy demand, the amount of uranium released into the nature is rising day by day owing to the increasing number of nuclear power plants. The search for economic and effective removal for the Uranium-238 occupies the agenda of scientists because it negatively affects the health of human and natural habitats and leads to ecotoxicological risks. Adsorption is a eco-friendly process which eliminate the use of chemicals. Adsorbent is a main actor on adsorption process so it should have high adsorption capacity, reusable, economic and abundant in nature. Dasit is a type of volcanic frozen rock that has an aphanitic texture to porphyritic and has an intermediate composition between andesite and rhyolite. In this study aims to investigate the adsorption of Uranium-238 from aqueous solutions with column system. Dasit stone (collected from Meydan Volcaino in Van) which has 250 mesh particle size was filled to column. Prepared Uranium-238 solution was feed to column with a peristaltic pump at fixed flow rate (25 mL/min). Under optimum operational conditions maximum removal yield was observed as 84%. In the light of the experimental data obtained, it can be said that Dasit has a certain potential in the removal of Uranium-238</p>

      <b>Abstract</b>
    </summary>
<p>Waste composition has changed, and the amounts of waste have increased every passing day with technological advances, urbanization, industrialization, improvement of life standards and rapid population growth. The components of waste in Turkey are 68% organic waste, 13% recyclable solid waste and 19% other waste. Solid waste management eliminates or minimizes the adverse impacts on the environment and human health, and provides economic development and improved living conditions/quality. In Turkey, which targeted the industrial development, because it had the priority for production in 1970s and 1980s, there was a great and speedy increase in industrial solid waste materials in the parallel of production amount and diversity. Although the attempts of the construction and operation of regular depositing areas are being performed, they are considerably low. For the solution of the solid effluent problem in our country by Environment and Forest Ministry, it is seen as the main issue that operating the “Solid Effluent Removing Facilities" is of the key role in preservation of the environment and hindering the pollution from domestic uses. Although Erzincan province has many natural beauties, there is a sanitary landfill only in its central district. In district municipalities, solid wastes are collected in hazardous waste storage areas. The leachate produced by the solid waste landfill is collected and then discharged to the receiving environment after being purified in the Erzincan Municipality waste water treatment plant located next to the facility. This study will evaluate practices, problems and solution offers in the solid waste management adaptation and development processes.</p>
