      <b>Abstract</b>
    </summary>
<p>Van, the most crowded province in the east of Turkey, is afflicted by intense air pollution especially in winter. Permanence and transport of air pollutants are closely associated with the region’s meteorological features. Hourly and annual variations in PM<sub>10</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> air pollutants and temperature, wind, pressure, and humidity atmospheric variables were investigated in Van city center for 2015–2020. A multiple non-linear regression (MLNR) model was used to research the effect of meteorological parameters on air quality. Stepwise and best-subset statistical methods were applied to optimize estimators in the MNLR model. In the winter months, increases above limit values were observed for PM<sub>10</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> linked to increases in low-quality fuel consumption due to reducing temperatures in the evenings. Spearman analysis showed there were moderate inverse correlations with temperature (R<sup>2</sup> = -0.42) and wind speed (R<sup>2</sup> = -0.42) and weak positive correlations with pressure (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.35) and humidity (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.22) for the air quality index. The MNLR model using minimum temperature (T<sub>min</sub>), average wind speed (W<sub>s</sub>), the maximum pressure (P<sub>max</sub>), and average humidity (H<sub>avg</sub>) was the most successful (R = 0.53, RMSE = 0.24) air quality model. The reduction in air quality was associated with colder temperatures, lower wind speed, higher atmospheric pressure and higher humidity. In conclusion, policymakers and implementors should pay attention to local climate features to effectively minimize urban air pollution.</p>

      <b>Abstract</b>
    </summary>
<p>Bioethanol production from algal biomass is a promising alternative for sustainable biofuel production. Algae possess a high photosynthetic capacity and an adaptive ability to thrive under harsh environmental conditions. The potential properties of Scenedesmus acuminatus CCALA 436 were assessed in this research for its bioethanol efficiency, and the effects of growing the algae in wastewater and at different concentrations of mepiquat chloride were studied. Also, pre-treatment efficiencies of different concentrations of calcium oxide were carried out on microalgae biomass. Superoxide dismutase, catalase activity, glutathione, and malondialdehyde contents of microalgae were examined, and the changes in chlorophyll, photoprotective carotenoid contents, and protein concentrations were determined. The results revealed that the maximum sugar and ethanol contents of Scenedesmus acuminatus CCALA 436 were 44.7 ± 1.5% and 20.32 g/L, respectively, for 50% wastewater and mepiquat chloride (2.5 mg/L) after pre-treatment with calcium oxide (0.08%). Additionally, the levels of oxidative enzymes varied depending on the wastewater concentrations. These findings indicate Scenedesmus acuminatus CCALA 436 grown in wastewater and mepiquat chloride can be used for the treatment of wastewater and the production of ethanol and high-value products such as carotenoid.

      <b>Abstract</b>
    </summary>
<p>The electrooxidation process, one of the advanced oxidation processes, is one of the effective treatment processes used in treating various industrial wastewaters. This study investigated the treatment of olive mill wastewater using the electrooxidation process. This study includes the effects of different experimental parameters on chemical oxygen demand and total phenol removal efficiencies in olive mill wastewater. Ti/IrO<sub>2</sub>/RuO<sub>2</sub> mesh plates as anode material and Ti mesh plates as cathode material were used in the study. The effects of stirring rate, dilution factor, pH, type of support electrolyte, the concentration of support electrolyte, and current density on chemical oxygen demand and total phenol removal efficiencies were examined in the experiments using a batch reactor. The study found that the chemical oxygen demand and total phenol removal rates were 96.93% and 100% under optimum conditions, respectively. According to the treatment data obtained, it can be said that olive mill wastewater can be treated by the electrooxidation method and can be proposed as a pretreatment system before entering biological treatment.

      <b>Abstract</b>
    </summary>
<p>In this study, the adsorption of Auramine O (AuO) dye using bottom sludge (BS) was investigated in batch and continuous systems. The BS was characterized by EDX, BET, XRD, DLS, ζ-potential, SEM, FTIR, helium pycnometer, and mercury porosimetry. The kinetic and isotherm data were fitted to pseudo-second-order and Langmuir models. The maximum amount of adsorption calculated from the Langmuir isotherm model was 5.09 mg/g. Thermodynamic studies showed that adsorption was endothermic and occurred spontaneously. Thomas, Clark, and Yoon-Nelson models were suitable (R<sup>2</sup> > 0.95 for all these models) to explain the dynamic behavior of AuO-BS in the column system. Increased bed depth increased breakthrough time, while the breakthrough time declined with increased initial AuO concentration and flow rate. Optimum conditions were determined for the batch system as 4 g of BS dose, 100 rpm agitation speed, and 90 min reaction time; optimum conditions for the column system were 3 cm bed depth, 0.14 mL/min flow rate, reaction time of 181 h; and optimum conditions for both systems were 100 mg/L AuO concentration, 20 °C reaction temperature and pH 6.18 (natural). Under these conditions, the amounts of AuO adsorbed in batch and column systems were calculated as 2.06 mg/g (89.75%) and 2.63 mg/g (47.13%), respectively. The studies showed that efficient remediation of AuO from aquatic environments is possible with BS.

    </summary>
<p>Particulate matter is one of the primary atmospheric pollutants with significant effects on human health. Accurately and reliably forecasting air quality for future horizons makes it possible to take the necessary precautions to minimize potential risks. In this study, monthly PM<sub>10</sub> concentration forecasts were made for Erzurum in Turkey. The first ten years of monthly data between 2006 and 2018 were used for training of the model, and the last two years were used to test predictions with the model. PM<sub>10</sub> data had trends and seasonal effects removed with seasonal adjustment and were decomposed to three levels with MODWT. For each subseries obtained, modelling was performed with appropriate coefficients chosen with ARIMA. Particulate forecasting was performed with wavelet reconstruction for the approximate and detail series. According to the experimental results, the wavelet-transform based hybrid WT-ARIMA model was more successful than the traditional ARIMA model with regard to the RMSE, R<sup>2</sup>, IA, MAE and MAPE. The developed model had values of RMSE 1.50, R<sup>2</sup> 0.99, IA 99.92%, MAE 1.26 and MAPE 3.02%. The proposed model may be used as reference for early warning in regions with high air pollution observed due to accurate forecasting capability for particulate matter pollution.
