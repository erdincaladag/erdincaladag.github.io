      <b>Abstract</b>
    </summary>
<p>Van, the most crowded province in the east of Turkey, is afflicted by intense air pollution especially in winter. Permanence and transport of air pollutants are closely associated with the region’s meteorological features. Hourly and annual variations in PM<sub>10</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> air pollutants and temperature, wind, pressure, and humidity atmospheric variables were investigated in Van city center for 2015–2020. A multiple non-linear regression (MLNR) model was used to research the effect of meteorological parameters on air quality. Stepwise and best-subset statistical methods were applied to optimize estimators in the MNLR model. In the winter months, increases above limit values were observed for PM<sub>10</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> linked to increases in low-quality fuel consumption due to reducing temperatures in the evenings. Spearman analysis showed there were moderate inverse correlations with temperature (R<sup>2</sup> = -0.42) and wind speed (R<sup>2</sup> = -0.42) and weak positive correlations with pressure (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.35) and humidity (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.22) for the air quality index. The MNLR model using minimum temperature (T<sub>min</sub>), average wind speed (W<sub>s</sub>), the maximum pressure (P<sub>max</sub>), and average humidity (H<sub>avg</sub>) was the most successful (R = 0.53, RMSE = 0.24) air quality model. The reduction in air quality was associated with colder temperatures, lower wind speed, higher atmospheric pressure and higher humidity. In conclusion, policymakers and implementors should pay attention to local climate features to effectively minimize urban air pollution.</p>

      <b>Abstract</b>
    </summary>
<p>Bioethanol production from algal biomass is a promising alternative for sustainable biofuel production. Algae possess a high photosynthetic capacity and an adaptive ability to thrive under harsh environmental conditions. The potential properties of Scenedesmus acuminatus CCALA 436 were assessed in this research for its bioethanol efficiency, and the effects of growing the algae in wastewater and at different concentrations of mepiquat chloride were studied. Also, pre-treatment efficiencies of different concentrations of calcium oxide were carried out on microalgae biomass. Superoxide dismutase, catalase activity, glutathione, and malondialdehyde contents of microalgae were examined, and the changes in chlorophyll, photoprotective carotenoid contents, and protein concentrations were determined. The results revealed that the maximum sugar and ethanol contents of Scenedesmus acuminatus CCALA 436 were 44.7 ± 1.5% and 20.32 g/L, respectively, for 50% wastewater and mepiquat chloride (2.5 mg/L) after pre-treatment with calcium oxide (0.08%). Additionally, the levels of oxidative enzymes varied depending on the wastewater concentrations. These findings indicate Scenedesmus acuminatus CCALA 436 grown in wastewater and mepiquat chloride can be used for the treatment of wastewater and the production of ethanol and high-value products such as carotenoid.
