<p>Along with international oragizations and national states, cities are now particularly influential in policymaking to protect the global environment. This course, thus, will explore the foundations and evolution of environmental politics and policy at three fundamental levels of governance: the global, national and sub-national levels. The course will provide the students with key aspects of major environmental problems, evolution of the international politics of environmental issues as well as specific organizations, actors and policies of contemporary environmental governance.</p>

<p>The course is designed to give a broad theoretical and practical foundation within wastewater treatment. This also includes sludge treatment. An overview of typical wastewater characteristics, how this may affect relevant treatment processes, will be given, in addition to treatment and effluent requirements. The course will cover the theoretical foundation, and practical configurations, design and operation of relevant wastewater treatment processes, including physical-, chemical- and biological processes. It will also focuse on how to combine different treatment processes to meet present and future effluent requirements. Sludge handling and treatment will also be covered.</p>
